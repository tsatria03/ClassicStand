new in 1.3.

Made it so you can choose how much of an Ingredient can go in the pitcher when making lemonade.

Improved the daily summery tracker by adding some stats that weren't their before. It's also now slightly reworded for better readability.
Made it so the game remembers the last item that you've recently selected. This is useful for returning back to a spisific item in the menu without having to start over from the top of the menu again.

Made it so resetting your game's progress will now cause you to restart the game for the changes to propperly take effect.
Added the ability to set your business title at the start of a new game. You'll be asked to set this upon starting a new save file for the game.

new in 1.1.

Made it so temperatures are no longer randomized throughout the day. The game now uses a dynamic temperature system that scales based on the current day, and time of day. Each day defines a temperature range, which increases the more the game progresses.
Made it so the game's clock time folows the day time pattern, instead of randomizing the time each day. It will also denote weather the time is set to A-M or P-M when reading the time in the game's main menu.
Made it so the day and level systems are now separated. Each day contains 6 levels, representing time blocks, such as early morning, early afternoon, mid afternoon, early evening, midnight, and late night. After reaching level 6, the level resets back to 1, and the day increases by 1.
Made it so the pricing system has  now been reworked to scale with both the current day and level. This allows for gradual and realistic economic inflation. This system encourages long-term strategy, high-stakes resource management, and optimized pricing.
