new in 1.1.
Fixed a bug where costs of items wouldn't update properly upon starting a new day after copying or exporting a daily summery.
new in 1.0
Added the ability to copy and export your daily summeries to a file that show up at the end of each day.
Added the ability to view the daily summary of your business at the end of each day. This includes things like your overall balance, your current inventory, and how much lemonade is left in the pitcher.
You can now buy ice to make a pitcher of lemonade.
Made it so temperatures are no longer randomized throughout the day. The game now uses a dynamic temperature system that scales based on the current day, and time of day. Each day defines a temperature range, which increases the more the game progresses.
Made it so the game's clock time folows the day time pattern, instead of randomizing the time each day. It will also denote weather the time is set to A-M or P-M when reading the time in the main interface.
Made it so the day and level systems are now separated. Each day contains 6 levels, representing time blocks, such as early morning, early afternoon, mid afternoon, early evening, midnight, and late night. After reaching level 6, the level resets back to 1, and the day increases by 1.
Made it so the pricing system has been reworked to scale with both the current day and level. This allows for gradual and realistic economic inflation. This system encourages long-term strategy, high-stakes resource management, and optimized pricing.
Enhanced all purchase dialogs to now include the quantity bought, the total cost of the purchase, and the remaining cash after the transaction.
Added the ability to drink the lemonade you made and poured into a cup.
Added some sounds for making and pouring lemonade in the game.
Changed the way pitchers work for making lemonade. You can now see how many liters of lemonade has been added to it, rather than it just saying empty or full.
Made it so you are able to type how many cups of lemonade you'd like to pour from the pitcher.
Added the ability to pour lemonade from the pitcher into cups for selling.
Fixed some bugs with selling cups of lemonade.
Reduced the cost of all items to make the game easier to play in earlier levels.
Made it so buying items now adds to your inventory instead of replacing it.
Made it so cash is correctly deducted based on the price quantity of the item.
You can now buy salt and water to make a pitcher of lemonade.
Added some menu related sounds to the game.
Converted the entire game to nvgt.
